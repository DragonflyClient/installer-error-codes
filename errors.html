            <h1>Common fixes</h1>
            <p>Since most of the problems have a similar origin, you should try using the following common fixes in order to solve the problem. Please follow the order of the common fixes when using them. There is no guarantee that these fixes will solve
                the error, so feel free to contact our support if your problem is still present.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Run as administrator</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes, the Dragonfly Installer doesn’t have enough permissions to perform certain actions. In this case, you have to run it with administrator privileges. This can be done by following the steps below: </p>
                    <ol class="enumeration-letter-list" type="a">
                        <li>Create a file named start.bat in the directory with the installer.</li>
                        <li>Edit the file with an editor of your choice.</li>
                        <li>Copy & paste the following line into the file and make sure to replace [Installer Name] with the name of the installer file (including the .jar ending!). The default name is Dragonfly-Installer.jar. java -jar [Installer Name]
                        </li>
                        <li>Save the file and close your editor</li>
                        <li>Open the file’s context menu by right-clicking it and select “Run as administrator”.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to confirm the start in the upcoming menu.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Alternatively, download our prepared start script
                        <a href="https://cdn.icnet.dev/minecraftmod/installer/run-as-administrator.bat">here</a>, put it in the right directory and repeat the steps e) and f). Note that this is only supported, if the installer file is named Dragonfly-Installer.jar.
                        If it is not, you can still rename it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Download the latest version</h4>
                    <p>It may be the case, that the error you are running into was already solved in a newer version of the installer, or it came up because you are using an old version. To make sure that this isn’t the case, always run the latest version
                        of the Dragonfly Installer. You can download it on our website, or simply click
                        <a href="https://inceptioncloud.net/download">here</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Restart your device</h4>
                    <p>We know you heard this very often, but it’s sometimes so simple. Just try to restart the device you are running the installer on. This will sometimes fix nasty errors that we spent hours on trying to solve.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Try error-specific solutions</h4>
                    <p>When checking the
                        <a href="#error-codes-list">list of error
                        codes</a>, there is always a phrase that explains when and why this error occurs. This will probably help you find a solution on your own. Sometimes, there are also error-specific solutions that we add to
                        the list. Just click an entry and it will expand itself showing some extra things you can try in order to solve them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Support</h4>
                    <p>If none of the above tips could help you solve your error, than there is now other way than asking us for help. You can get support for all your problems related to any Inception Cloud product on our official Discord server. There,
                        you have the option to either write a support ticket or join the support queue, while the latter is used for urgent problems, we prefer the former.</p>
                    <p>Note: When using our support offer, make sure you have the log files of your Installer ready, since our time will most likely need them to provide you with a solution. Their name ends with .log and you can find them in the directory
                        the installer ran in. Always take the latest log file, you can identify it by it’s name which contains the time and date in the format
                        <a href="https://nsdateformatter.com/">HH_mm_ss-dd_MM_yyyy</a>.</p>
